# A simple Docker exercise

Docker is a useful tool for creating containers to run code in an isolated environment, that means no dependency failures!  This repo builds a container orchestration in docker-compose for a basic Flask API that returns a simple database from another container, which may just happen to be this year's Eurovision results.

Just run `docker-compose up` and check out the results on your [localhost](http://localhost:9200/)!
